The opening post for this blog. Obviously.

This isnâ€™t my first time blogging, but because Iâ€™m lazy and bad at writing, I usually give up after one or two posts. Lately Iâ€™ve wanted to build a few things in my free time, so Iâ€™m writing to stay motivated. Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself â€” I do ["the king of all jobs"](https://voz.vn/t/it-vua-cua-cac-nghe.252534/), programming, so the title of this post is inspired by the first lesson every developer learns. Itâ€™s a bit boring, butâ€¦ whatever, I suck at writing anyway. Plus, whoâ€™s even gonna read this ðŸ˜‚? Mostly I just need something to kick things off and make it feel less empty.

Alright, thatâ€™s it for the intro. Hopefully the next posts (if this blog doesnâ€™t die young like the previous ones ðŸ˜…) will be better. See you around.
