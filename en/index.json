Obviously.\nThis isnâ€™t my first time blogging, but because Iâ€™m lazy and bad at writing, I usually give up after one or two posts. Lately Iâ€™ve wanted to build a few things in my free time, so Iâ€™m writing to stay motivated. Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself â€” I do \u0026ldquo;the king of all jobs\u0026rdquo;, programming, so the title of this post is inspired by the first lesson every developer learns. Itâ€™s a bit boring, butâ€¦ whatever, I suck at writing anyway. Plus, whoâ€™s even gonna read this ðŸ˜‚? Mostly I just need something to kick things off and make it feel less empty.\nAlright, thatâ€™s it for the intro. Hopefully the next posts (if this blog doesnâ€™t die young like the previous ones ðŸ˜…) will be better.
